# Udacity-Projects
File contains several basic projects from my Udacity course Intro to Programming.

##Advanture Game
Use python
Project Instructions:
In this project, make a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. You can find an example in the workspace below. Try it out to get a feeling for how the game works!
In order to build a program like this, we should first completely understand what it does. Take a notepad out, and play the game multiple times. The game will present you some scenarios and ask you to make one of 2 choices, by entering 1 or 2. In your notepad, record what happens each time you make a certain choice.
Note: Before doing this project, be sure to have completed the Style and Structure lesson in Intro to Python, Part 2.
As you can see, this is only a very short game with a couple of choices available to the player. We did that on purpose, to keep it simple. If we were making a complete game, we would expand it a great deal, and probably give the player a whole world to explore. But for this project, the idea is to focus on some key things that we need if want to make a working game:
  •	The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
  •	Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
  •	The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
  •	The game has conditions for winning and losing.
  •	When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
These are the key features that your project will need to have in order to make it into a playable game. We'll go over each of them in more detail below.

##Animal Trading Card
Use HTML and CSS
Project Instructions:
1.	Download and unzip animal-trading-cards-master.zip. Inside, you'll find card.html, styles.css, placeholder.png, and the design-prototype.png.
2.	Next, open card.html and replace the placeholder image and information with your favorite animal's image and information. For the image, you will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Later, we’ll talk about how you can fix this problem using responsive images. Also, don't forget to change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. So, alt="name-of-your-animal" should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.
3.	Once you've added your favorite animal's image and information, add the proper CSS to styles.css to recreate the design-prototype.png by applying the style rules in step 4. You’ll need to modify card.html to include attributes and use selectors to specify the elements you want to style. Also, make sure to link to your stylesheet in card.html or else your CSS will not be applied to your webpage.
4.	The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:
  •	italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
  •	bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
  •	no dots for the animal's list items
  •	border around the animal's name, image, and information
  •	border around the animal's information
  •	spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
